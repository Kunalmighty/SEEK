# SEEK
This is a Windows Universal App, best viewed on both mobile devices and desktops.  
SEEK consists of 2 apps: the user app itself (‘SEEK’), and an admin app to view or add product information to the Azure database 
(‘SeekAdmin’).  
Only Phones/ Tablets are searchable right now.  
In the near future, there will be fully featured databases involving other electronics, motor vehicles, and other products.   

SEEK implements Azure Mobile App Services, Azure SQL, REST interfaces, Authentication, Authorization (User and Admin), Web jobs, 
Azure Storage and Mobile Client & Security.
